Gleichzeitig analysieren wir, wie sich Ladezeit, Energiefluss und Softwaretakt zu den neuen Qualitätsparametern entwickeln.⚡ Besonders lesenswert:Warum die BEV-Architektur klassische Premiumsignale entwertet, wie sich das Wertschöpfungssystem um die Batterie herum verschiebt, weshalb Energie-Services ein strategisches Muss für OEMs werden – und welche Hersteller bereits dabei sind, diesen Übergang aktiv zu gestalten.Datenblick – Auszug:• Zellchemie: NCM/NCA → LFP/LMFP → Semi-Solid → Feststoff• Ladeleistung: 120–150 kW (2018) → 200–270 kW (2023) → >300 kW (2025)• HV-Architekturen: modulare E/E → zonal → SDV (2025+)• Wertschöpfung: Vom Fahrzeug zur Energieplattformhashtag#MobilitySignals hashtag#Elektromobilität hashtag#Batterietechnologie hashtag#Ladeinfrastruktur hashtag#Automotive hashtag#AutomotiveIndustry hashtag#BEV hashtag#EVCharging hashtag#BatteryIndustry hashtag#SoftwareDefinedVehicle hashtag#SDV hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Energie hashtag#EnergyTransition hashtag#Automobilindustrie hashtag#ZukunftDerMobilität hashtag#EVTech hashtag#OEMDear colleagues, partners and subscribers,Mobility Signals — #12 is live: Technology Trends Reshaping the Market.❓ What it’s about:A deep dive into the forces currently redefining automotive competitiveness: battery chemistry, charging performance, software architectures, thermal systems and integration.Why these systems matter more today than many traditional mechanical differentiators — and what this means for OEMs still organized around combustion-era structures.We unpack how fast the BEV technology stack is evolving and how charging behavior, thermal stability and software cadence are becoming the real markers of product quality.⚡ Worth reading:How BEV architectures erode traditional premium signals, why the battery is becoming the new value engine, and why energy services are a strategic necessity — not an optional add-on — for future OEM relevance.Data snapshot:• Cell chemistry evolution: NCM/NCA → LFP/LMFP → Semi-Solid → Solid-State• Charging: 120–150 kW (2018) → 200–270 kW (2023) → >300 kW (2025)• Architectures: modular E/E → zonal → full SDV (2025+)• Value creation: From car to energy system",
