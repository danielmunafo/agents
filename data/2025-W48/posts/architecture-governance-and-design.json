More products. More models. More everything.What started as a technology swamp has become a technology blizzard — low visibility, high speed, infinite choice.And this is why Enterprise Architecture (EA) matters more than ever.Modern EA isn’t control. It’s orchestration.EA aligns teams around capabilities, not productsEA prevents innovation from turning into chaosEA keeps legacy, cloud, and AI ecosystems coherentThe swamp created complexity The blizzard creates fragmentation EA is how we navigate both",
